    "\n",
    "- This assignment consists of both programming and theory questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Q4 is bonus for both undergraduate and graduate students.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To switch between cell for code and for markdown, see the menu -> Cell -> Cell Type\n",
    "    \n",
    "- You can directly type Latex equations into markdown cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Typing with Latex\\markdown is required for all the written questions. Handwritten answers will not be accepted. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- If a question requires a picture, you could use this syntax $\"<img src=\"\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\"$ to include them within your ipython notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the autograder\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will find two assignments on Gradescope that correspond to HW2: \"HW2 - Programming\" and \"HW2 - Non-programming\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will submit your code for the autograder on \"HW2 - Programming\" in the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * kmeans.py\n",
    "    * gmm.py\n",
    "    * semisupervised.py\n",
    "\n",
    "- All you will have to do is to copy your implementations of the classes \"Kmeans\", \"GMM\", \"CleanData\", \"SemiSupervised\" onto the respective files. We provided you different .py files and we added libraries in those files please DO NOT remove those lines and add your code after those lines. Note that these are the only allowed libraries that you can use for the homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You are allowed to make as many submissions until the deadline as you like. Additionally, note that the autograder tests each function separately, therefore it can serve as a useful tool to help you debug your code if you are not sure of what part of your implementation might have an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For the \"HW2 - Non-programming\" part, you will download your jupyter notbook as html and submit it as a PDF on Gradescope. To download the notebook as PDF, click on \"File\" on the top left corner of this page and select \"Download as > PDF\". The non-programming part corresponds to Q2, Q3.3 (both your response and the generated images with your implementation) and Q4.2**\n",
    "- **When submitting to Gradescope, please make sure to mark the page(s) corresponding to each problem/sub-problem.**"

Stressing the importance of having minimum down time for refining, you have been tasked to find a way to predict whether a machine will need to be repaired or not. In order to aid you on the task, the company has supplied you with historical telemetric data from all of the machines. The features range from averages of temperature, frequencies, and other salient observations of the units. The specifics of the features are not pertinent to the classification; it can be assured that each feature is statistically significant. A unit is given a 1 if it is broken and a 0 otherwise.\n",
