        Note: 
        1. SGD loops over all examples in the dataset one by one and learns a gradient from each example 
        2. One iteration here is one round of forward and backward propagation on one example of the dataset. 
           So if the dataset has 1000 examples, 1000 iterations will constitute an epoch 
        3. Append loss after every 2000 iterations for plotting loss plots
        4. It is fine if you get a noisy plot since learning on one example at a time adds variance to the 
           gradients learnt
        5. You can use SGD with any neural net type
